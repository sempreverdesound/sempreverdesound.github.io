**SempreVerde** is the solo project of Luca Giuliani, Bologna-based singer-songwriter and music producer, former member
of the electropop duo
[Divinae Miranda](https://open.spotify.com/intl-it/artist/2wvpQCjOmseuzCLC9orKpn?si=SX406iOfSi-U_9eEje4gaw).

The project was born out of the need to experiment with new sounds, mixing *trance* and *melodic techno* elements with
lyrics inspired by the Italian singer-songwriter tradition of a more electronic and alternative kind, from
*Franco Battiato* to *Subsonica* and *Blue Vertigo*. And while on the one hand the dark aspect of techno serves as a 
thrust to sing about anger and disillusionment, openly dealing with social and political issues within the songs
starting precisely with the ecological issue recalled by the name, on the other hand the imagery of *clubbing* is used
as a glue to hold together a more collective and joyful aspect, which takes shape in the tribal rituals of dance.
